# Understanding f32 and f64 in Rust

## Overview
Rust provides two floating-point types: `f32` (32-bit) and `f64` (64-bit). Both follow the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic.

## Key Differences

### Precision
- `f32`: Single precision, ~6-7 decimal digits of precision
- `f64`: Double precision, ~15-17 decimal digits of precision

### Memory Usage
- `f32`: 4 bytes
- `f64`: 8 bytes

### Range
- `f32`: ±3.4E+38 to ±3.4E-38
- `f64`: ±1.8E+308 to ±2.2E-308

### Use Cases

#### f32 is preferred when:
- Working with graphics and game development
- Memory is constrained
- Performance is critical
- Full double precision isn't necessary
- Working with hardware that natively uses 32-bit floats

#### f64 is preferred when:
- Higher precision is required
- Working with scientific calculations
- Dealing with large numerical ranges
- Financial calculations (though decimals are often better)
- Default choice for general-purpose floating-point calculations

### Performance Considerations
- `f32` operations are generally faster
- Modern CPUs might handle `f64` just as efficiently
- `f32` arrays use less cache space
- SIMD operations can process more `f32` values simultaneously

### Common Pitfalls
1. Precision loss in `f32` during complex calculations
2. Comparison issues due to floating-point rounding
3. Accumulated errors in long calculation chains
4. Platform-dependent behavior

## Best Practices
1. Use `f64` by default unless you have specific reasons not to
2. Avoid direct equality comparisons
3. Consider using decimal types for financial calculations
4. Document precision requirements in your code
